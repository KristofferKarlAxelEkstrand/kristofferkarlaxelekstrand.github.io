If you&apos;re looking for more info, head over to <a href="https://kristofferekstrand.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kristofferekstrand.se</a> instead.</p><p><strong>What I do:</strong> I&apos;m a project manager who builds digital solutions and experiences - mainly focused on e-commerce, but also design, development, and other digital projects. Plus music technology stuff like the Adventure Kid Waveforms.</p><p><strong>Work I&apos;m proud of:</strong> As a frontend developer with a very skilled team at Vinoteket (Sweden&apos;s big online wine store), I redesigned and optimized the web for technical SEO, worked with tracking, optimized for web vitals, and removed all problems in the frontend code which both made it a better user experience but also affected SEO positively. My role primarily focused on frontend development, but I also contributed to brand identity work including logo updates and various other aspects of the digital experience.</p><p>For more details, check out my main site at <a href="https://kristofferekstrand.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kristofferekstrand.se</a></p><p><strong>Interested in working together?</strong> I&apos;m always up for interesting projects - whether it&apos;s e-commerce, web development, or anything music tech related. At Grand Public, I work with a creative branding agency and great developer team, so we can deliver something neat and impactful.</p><p><a href="mailto:toffe@kristofferekstrand.se">toffe@kristofferekstrand.se</a></p></header><hr><section id="projects"><h3>Projects</h3><p class="preamble">These are smaller projects or apps, or sometimes something entirely different. Many are web-related, but they can also involve sound or music design, technology, cooking, or a mix of everything.

It started as a hobby project but turned into something people actually use.</p><p><strong>Why I made it:</strong> I was playing live with digital synths and needed them to sound more analog without eating up CPU. Traditional additive synthesis was too heavy for my laptop on stage, so I tried baking harmonics into single-cycle waveforms instead.</p><p><strong>How it&apos;s used:</strong> These waveforms help make digital synthesizers sound richer while using minimal processing power. They work well for hardware manufacturers with limited processing and software developers who need royalty-free content.</p><p><strong>Open source:</strong> I released everything into the public domain when UK schools started using them for education. Now they&apos;re in synthesizers and samplers from various companies.</p></article></section><hr><section id="sites"><h3>Personal Projects &amp; Lab Sites</h3><p class="preamble">Side projects where I experiment with different technologies, music stuff, and web solutions.

It&apos;s an experiment with how much you can solve in the frontend - like search and filtering - on top of a static site. Also an SEO experiment, and hopefully it&apos;ll make me cook more and better.</p></article><article><h4>Musikapparaten</h4><p class="url"><a href="https://musikapparaten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">musikapparaten.com</a></p><p class="url"><a href="https://musikapparaten.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">musikapparaten.se</a></p><p>Two sites for my sound production work.
