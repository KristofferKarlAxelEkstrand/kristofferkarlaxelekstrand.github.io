MKONG was a music technology and sound design company specializing in sample production, recording techniques, and audio tool development for digital music production. We created multi-sampled instruments, synthesizer presets, developed single-cycle waveforms, and pioneered recording techniques for synthesizer and sampler content. The company developed the Adventure Kid Wave Forms (AKWF), which became a widely-used open-source waveform library implemented in numerous synthesizers and samplers worldwide. Our work involved extensive studio recording, sound design, and the creation of professional sample libraries and synthesizer presets for electronic music production.
