Sparkling was a creative ad agency that dabbled in all things marketing - 3D
rendering, print production, websites, email marketing, newsletters (both
physical and digital), CD-ROM production, branding, ads, direct mail. This was
my first real experience in the working world, where I did everything from
branding and setting up e-commerce solutions to marketing and development. My
role was Graphic Designer and Art Director but I was a developer as well. I
designed brands, did print production, web design, programmed websites, and
worked on early stages of digital products like Netpublicator.
