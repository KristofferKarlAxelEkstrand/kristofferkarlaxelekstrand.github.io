Vinoteket is Sweden's leading online wine store that has been delivering wine to
doorsteps for over 10 years. In 2023, around three million wine bottles from
Vinoteket were placed on Swedish dinner tables. The company offers wine, beer,
non-alcoholic beverages, and spirits with a curated selection guided by
sommelier expertise. They focus on quality over quantity and take an active
stance against bag-in-box wines, offering bottles from 99 kronor with the motto
"drink less and better."
