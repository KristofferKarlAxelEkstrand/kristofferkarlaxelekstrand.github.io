**What it is:** A collection of over 4,000 single-cycle waveforms that
synthesizer companies use in their products. It started as a hobby project but
turned into something people actually use.

**Why I made it:** I was playing live with digital synths and needed them to
sound more analog without eating up CPU. Traditional additive synthesis was too
heavy for my laptop on stage, so I tried baking harmonics into single-cycle
waveforms instead.

**How it's used:** These waveforms help make digital synthesizers sound richer
while using minimal processing power. They work well for hardware manufacturers
with limited processing and software developers who need royalty-free content.

**Open source:** I released everything into the public domain when UK schools
started using them for education. Now they're in synthesizers and samplers from
various companies.
