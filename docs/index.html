                <h3>Projects</h3>
                <p class="preamble">These are smaller projects or apps—or sometimes something entirely different. Many are web-related, but they can also involve sound or music design, technology, cooking, or a mix of everything. It’s a space for just about anything.</p>

                    <h4>AKWF FREE - Adventure Kid Wave Forms</h4>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/adventure-kid-waveforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adventurekid.se</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Single-cycle waveforms started as a hobby—just a fun way to mess with sound. They're tiny bits of audio, but useful. I first got into them while coding my own synth. I wanted to do additive synthesis, but it was tough to pull off with just sine waves, mainly computation wise. So I cheated a bit—baked in extra harmonics and mixed waveforms. It worked surprisingly well.</p>
                    <p>That led me to sampling. I wanted my digital synths to sound more like analog ones, but also use less CPU since I was playing live. Lugging computers on stage wasn't ideal, but that's what I did. Waveforms were great because they used barely any memory, not much CPU and was great for that. They can be used in synths, samplers, and even drum machines. I started with a few simple waveforms, but it quickly grew into a big collection.</p>
                    <p>When this project got picked up for use in UK education, I released the waveforms into the public domain. They're free to use and bundle into anything.</p>
