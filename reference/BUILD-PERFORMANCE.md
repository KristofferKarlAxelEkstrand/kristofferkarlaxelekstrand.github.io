# Build Performance Monitoring

## What is Build Performance Monitoring?

Build performance monitoring tracks build execution times, file sizes, compression ratios, and optimization effectiveness to identify bottlenecks and measure optimization success.

## Why Monitor Build Performance?

- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find slowest build steps for optimization
- **Regression Detection**: Catch performance degradation early
- **Optimization Validation**: Measure effectiveness of build improvements
- **Size Budget Enforcement**: Alert when assets exceed size targets
- **Trend Analysis**: Track build performance over time

## How it's used in this project

### Automatic Monitoring

All builds automatically track performance metrics and generate detailed reports showing step-by-step timing, file sizes, and compression achievements.

### Build History

Performance data is automatically saved to `.build-history.json` for trend analysis and regression detection.

### Performance Reports

Every build generates a comprehensive performance report:

## Performance Tracking Features

### Step-by-Step Timing

Each build step is individually timed:

- **Duration**: Absolute time in milliseconds
- **Percentage**: Relative time of total build duration
- **Success Status**: Pass/fail for each step
- **Performance Warnings**: Alert for steps >5 seconds

### File Size Monitoring

Before/after file sizes tracked for optimization steps:

- **CSS Compilation**: Sass output size tracking
- **JS Processing**: Pre/post minification sizes
- **HTML Processing**: Entity encoding and minification
- **Image Optimization**: PNG and favicon generation savings

### Compression Metrics

Detailed compression analysis:

- **Compression Ratio**: Percentage reduction achieved
- **Bytes Saved**: Absolute file size reduction
- **Optimization Effectiveness**: Success rate per step

### Size Budget Enforcement

Automatic size budget validation:

- **Total Build Output**: 5MB limit
- **CSS Files**: 100KB limit
- **JavaScript Files**: 200KB limit
- **HTML Files**: 50KB limit

## Build History Analysis

### Automatic Data Collection

Every build automatically saves performance data:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-07T23:10:34.770Z",
  "buildType": "full",
  "duration": 5593,
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "CSS",
      "duration": 2180,
      "success": true,
      "beforeSize": 0,
      "afterSize": 3796,
      "compression": 0
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [],
  "totalSaved": 21488,
  "finalSize": 86244
}
```

### History Commands

Analyze build performance trends:

```bash
# View recent builds
npm run history
node build/build-history.js recent [count]

# Show performance trends
npm run history:trends
node build/build-history.js trends

# Comprehensive analysis
npm run history:recent
node build/build-history.js all
```

### Trend Analysis

Track performance over time:

- **Duration Trends**: Build time changes
- **Size Trends**: Output size evolution
- **Optimization Trends**: Compression effectiveness
- **Regression Detection**: Performance degradation alerts

## Performance Optimization Insights

### Bottleneck Identification

Common performance bottlenecks and solutions:

**Slow Steps Identified:**

- **Favicons**: Typically 60% of build time (7-8 seconds)
- **CSS Compilation**: Can be 10-15% for complex Sass
- **JS Minification**: Usually 4-8% of total time
- **HTML Validation**: May exceed 5 seconds

**Optimization Strategies:**

- Skip favicon generation in development builds
- Use fast build mode for development iteration
- Cache compiled assets when possible
- Parallel processing for independent steps

### Build Type Optimization

**Fast Build** (Development):

- Duration: ~2-3 seconds
- Skips: Minification, validation, favicon generation
- Focus: Quick iteration and development speed

**Full Build** (Production):

- Duration: ~10-15 seconds
- Includes: All optimizations, validation, compression
- Focus: Production quality and performance

### Performance Warnings

Automatic warnings for performance issues:

- **Step Duration >5s**: Identifies slow build steps
- **Size Budget Exceeded**: Alerts for oversized assets
- **Compression Failures**: Reports optimization issues
- **Trend Degradation**: Detects performance regression

## Configuration and Customization

### Size Budget Adjustment

Modify size limits in `build/build-manager.js`:

```javascript
const SIZE_BUDGETS = {
  'Total build output': 5 * 1024 * 1024, // 5MB
  CSS: 100 * 1024, // 100KB
  JS: 200 * 1024, // 200KB
  HTML: 50 * 1024, // 50KB
};
```

### Performance Thresholds

Adjust warning thresholds:

```javascript
// Warn for steps taking longer than 5 seconds
if (duration > 5000) {
  buildMetrics.warnings.push(`${name} took ${duration}ms (>5s)`);
}
```

### History Retention

Build history is automatically maintained:

- **Storage**: `.build-history.json` file
- **Retention**: No automatic cleanup (manual management)
- **Size**: Minimal impact on repository size

## Monitoring Integration

### CI/CD Integration

Performance monitoring integrates with GitHub Actions:

- **Automatic Reporting**: Build performance logged in CI
- **Regression Detection**: Failed builds on performance issues
- **Size Budget Enforcement**: Prevents deployment of oversized builds

### Development Workflow

Performance monitoring enhances development:

- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate performance impact visibility
- **Optimization Guidance**: Clear identification of improvement opportunities
- **Regression Prevention**: Early warning of performance degradation

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Performance Problems

**Slow Build Times:**

1. Check which step is taking the most time
2. Consider using fast build for development
3. Verify system resources and disk speed
4. Check for file system issues

**Size Budget Violations:**

1. Identify which assets exceed budgets
2. Review code for unnecessary dependencies
3. Check for unoptimized assets
4. Verify compression is working correctly

**Compression Failures:**

1. Check source file formats and quality
2. Verify optimization settings
3. Review Sharp library installation
4. Check for corrupted source files

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Detailed build performance
npm run build --verbose

# History analysis
npm run history:trends

# Standalone optimizations

## Performance Best Practices

### Optimized Development Workflow

- Run full builds before commits
- Monitor performance trends regularly
- Address warnings promptly

- Monitor asset sizes during development
- Use appropriate image formats
- Compress assets at source when possible

### Build Configuration

- Adjust size budgets based on project needs
- Configure performance thresholds appropriately
