Vinoteket is Sweden's leading online wine store and has been delivering wine to doorsteps for over 10 years. Last year (2023), a total of around three million bottles of wine from Vinoteket were placed on Swedish dinner tables. In addition to wine, the store also offers beer, non-alcoholic beverages, and spirits.
