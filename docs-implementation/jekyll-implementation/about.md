    <h3>Adventure Kid Waveforms</h3>
    <p>One of my most impactful projects is <a href="https://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/adventure-kid-waveforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Kid Waveforms (AKWF)</a> - a collection of over 4,000 single-cycle waveforms released into the public domain.</p>
    
    <p>What started as a personal need for better-sounding digital synthesizers has become a resource used by synthesizer manufacturers worldwide. Companies integrate these waveforms into their products, and educational institutions use them for teaching sound design.</p>
    
    <p>The project demonstrates how open source contributions can have unexpected reach and impact beyond their original scope.</p>

    <h3>Stockholm Tech Scene</h3>
    <p>I've been part of Stockholm's digital landscape since the early 2000s, working across agencies, startups, and established companies. The city's collaborative tech community and focus on design excellence has shaped my approach to building digital products.</p>
    
    <p>From early e-commerce platforms at Litium to modern Shopify solutions at Panagora, I've seen how technology choices and implementation quality directly impact business success.</p>
